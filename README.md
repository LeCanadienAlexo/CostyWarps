# CostyWarps
A side project made for my friend, The idea is simply to allow players to create and teleport to warps they created, with a specific level cost, increasing with each warp.

This plugin has a few features:

- Create, delete, and display a list of warps per user.
- Creating warps with an increasing level cost.
- Backups of the list of warps for 7 days.

For now, the plugin is pretty barebone, what I'd like to add in the future:

- A command to manually restore the list of warps to a backup (As of now, you're required to manually move and rename the backup in the project.
- A command to delete all warps (Starting fresh)
- Permissions
- More customisation (Warp limit per player, cost multiplier, different payment methods than levels, for example minerals, etc.)
- Integration with economy based plugins like Vault.

Please be aware that while you can use this plugin on a server I offer no warranty that it'll work without issue, but I will provide support if contacted via Discord.

I strive to improve and become a better developper with each project I complete, so any feedback would be very appreciated, which can be sent to me via Discord: **LeAlexo#1111**. I'll add the Github or Discord handle of anyone who helps me improve this repo in the readme.
